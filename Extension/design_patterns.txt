Design Patterns:

- Observer Pattern: In content.js, the setInterval function monitors the URL for changes, triggering data extraction if
a new URL is detected. This mimics the observer pattern, where changes in the observed subject (URL) initiate data scraping
and storage.

- Facade Pattern: background.js acts as a simplified interface to handle messages between content.js and popup.js, abstracting
the complexity of message routing and error handling between the components in the Chrome extension. This allows each component
to interact without directly managing communication intricacies.

- Template Pattern: The HTML structure in popup.html and its styling in style.css together establish a consistent UI template,
ensuring any dynamic updates from popup.js follow a uniform format for displaying fetched data. This is a static version of the
Template Pattern in UI, where the general layout and style are predetermine.
